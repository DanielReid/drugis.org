<h3>Release history</h3>

<h4>Release 0.10</h4>

<p>Release Date: 2010-06-21</p>

<p>
	We are happy to announce the release of ADDIS (Aggregate Data Drug Information System) version 0.10.
	In this release, we build upon meta-analysis (included since <a href="/addis0.4" title="ADDIS v0.4">ADDIS v0.4</a>) and network meta-analysis (included since <a href="/addis0.8" title="ADDIS v0.8">ADDIS v0.8</a>), to perform multi-criteria benefit-risk analysis of alternative treatment options.
	The benefit-risk method is based on <a href="http://smaa.fi" title="Stochastic Multicriteria Acceptability Analysis">SMAA</a>, and implemented using the <a href="http://smaa.fi/jsmaa" title="JSMAA">JSMAA</a> software.
	It is being developed specifically for medical and regulatory decision making by our research group, see our <a href="/publications" title="Publications">publications</a> for more information.
</p>

<p>
	We include an example case (benefit-risk assessment of anti-depressants) with ADDIS v0.10.
	To try out benefit-risk analysis, load the included file <code>data/hansen-analyses.xml</code>. 
	This file contains data we extracted from studies that were included in the Hansen et al., Annals of internal medicine, 143(6): 415-426, 2005 systematic review of second-generation antidepressants. 
	We also included several example analyses, including a benefit-risk model, "Hansen BR".
</p>

<h3>Running ADDIS</h3>

<p>
	Extract the addis-0.10.zip ZIP archive to a local directory. Then double-click
	the 'addis-0.10.jar' file. Now you should already have ADDIS 0.10 running
	with some provided example data.
</p>

<p>
	If double-clicking the JAR file did not launch ADDIS, you are most likely
	lacking the Java run-time environment. You can get this from
	<a href="http://java.com/" title="Dowload Java">java.com</a>.

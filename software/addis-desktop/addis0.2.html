<p>We are happy to announce the release of ADDIS (Aggregate Data Drug
Information System) version 0.2. The goal for this release was to develop an
experimental prototype that allows us to perform simple meta-analyses of
clinical trials data as well as benefit risk assessment based on SMAA.</p>

<p>This release has allowed us to develop a basic understanding of the problem
domain and to indentify the difficulties involved in developing software for
meta-analysis. Furthermore, it provides a starting point for discussions with
users and domain experts. At present, however, we do not recommend that you use
this software in your research, as the implementation is not yet mature.</p>

<h3>Getting ADDIS</h3>

<p>Download ADDIS version 0.2:
<a href="/files/addis-0.2.zip"
	title="Get ADDIS 0.2">addis-0.2.zip</a>
<br/>
Source code is also available:
<a href="http://github.com/drugis/addis/zipball/0.2"
	title="GET ADDIS 0.2 source">addis 0.2 source tag</a>
</p>

<h3>Running ADDIS</h3>

<p>
Extract the addis-0.2.zip ZIP archive to a local directory. Then double-click
the 'addis.jar' file. Now you should already have ADDIS 0.2 running with some
provided example data. Verify this by comparing your screen with the
screenshots below.
</p>

<p>
If double-clicking the JAR file did not launch ADDIS, you are most likely
lacking the Java run-time environment. You can get this from

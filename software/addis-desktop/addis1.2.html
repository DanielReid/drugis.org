<h3>Release history</h3>

<h4>Release 1.2.1</h4>

<p>Release Date: 2010-10-21</p>

<p>
	ADDIS v1.2.1 is a bugfix release. There was an issue with the newly introduced single-study benefit-risk analysis that prevented any domain object from being deleted or edited. This has been fixed.
</p>

<h4>Release 1.2</h4>

<p>Release Date: 2010-09-27</p>

<p>
	We are happy to announce the release of ADDIS (Aggregate Data Drug Information System) version 1.2.
	We deviate from our normal 3-monthly schedule to introduce an important feature: benefit-risk analysis based on a single study.
</p>

<p>
	In single-study benefit-risk models, measurements are based on a Beta approximation of the binomial success probability (dichotomous outcomes) or on a Normal approximation of a continuous outcome.
	The single-study models are created using the same benefit-risk wizard that is used to construct benefit-risk models based on (network) meta-analyses.
	The advantage of single-study benefit-risk models is that all measurements are absolute, and thus that the measurement scales are easily interpreted.
	It is also not necessary to run any sub-analyses to inform the benefit-risk model. 
	However, the SMAA simulation itself is a lot slower when Beta distributions are used.
</p>

<p>
	This release also fixes an annoying bug that surfaced on Windows: switching the preferences from MISSING to ORDINAL didn't always work.
</p>

<h3>Getting ADDIS</h3>

<p>
	Source code is also available:

	title="GET ADDIS 1.2.1 source">ADDIS v1.2.1 source tag</a>
</p>

<h3>Running ADDIS</h3>

<p>
	Extract the addis-1.2.1.zip ZIP archive to a local directory. Then double-click the 'addis-1.2.1.jar' file.
	Now you should see the ADDIS welcome screen, where you can choose to load an example data set, load a file, or create a new data set.
	If you've never used ADDIS, we recommend that you take a look at the example data set.
</p>

<p>
	If double-clicking the JAR file did not launch ADDIS, you are most likely
	lacking the Java run-time environment. You can get this from
	<a href="http://java.com/" title="Dowload Java">java.com</a>.

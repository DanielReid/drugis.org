<h3>Release history</h3>

<h4>Release 0.8.1</h4>

<p>Release Date: 2010-05-07</p>

<p>
ADDIS v0.8.1 is based on the new <a href="mtc" title="drugis.org MTC">MTC library</a> version 0.2, also released today.
The new version of the MTC library is significantly faster, uses much less memory, adds the newest insights from our research and correctly implements multi-variate normal distributions (in ADDIS v0.8, a disclaimer was added warning about imprecision of results from multi-arm studies).
In addition, several improvements were made to the user interface.
</p>

<h4>Release 0.8</h4>

<p>Release Date: 2010-04-27</p>

<p>
We are happy to announce the release of ADDIS (Aggregate Data Drug Information System) version 0.8.
In this release, we now offer you the ability to perform a network meta-analysis (or: mixed treatment comparison) on the data in ADDIS.
We believe ADDIS is the first software to offer this capability, and we have created our own model-generation algorithm for this.
The model generation is also available stand-alone, in the <a href="/mtc" title="MTC model generation library">MTC library</a>.
</p>

<p>
As we believe ADDIS is now genuinely useful, with network meta-analysis being beyond the capabilities of any other software available, starting from this release we will ensure that the data you enter into ADDIS will remain usable in future versions.
For this, we have created XML import/export functionality, so that you will be able to take your data with you in the next version and beyond.
</p>

<p>
To show off these new features, we now include a data file with the ADDIS distribution.
To try this out, after unpacking ADDIS v0.8, load the included file <code>data/hansen.xml</code>. 
This file contains data we extracted from studies that were included in the Hansen et al., Annals of internal medicine, 143(6): 415-426, 2005 systematic review of second-generation antidepressants. 
We also included several example analyses, both pair-wise and network meta-analysis.

<h3>Getting ADDIS</h3>

<p>
Source code is also available:

	title="GET ADDIS 0.8.1 source">ADDIS v0.8.1 source tag</a>
</p>

<h3>Running ADDIS</h3>

<p>
Extract the addis-0.8.zip ZIP archive to a local directory. Then double-click
the 'addis-0.8.1.jar' file. Now you should already have ADDIS 0.8.1 running
with some provided example data. Verify this by comparing your screen with the
screenshots below.
</p>

<p>
If double-clicking the JAR file did not launch ADDIS, you are most likely
lacking the Java run-time environment. You can get this from
<a href="http://java.com/" title="Dowload Java">java.com</a>.

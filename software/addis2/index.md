title: ADDIS 2
---

Aggregate Data Drug Information System (ADDIS) is an evidence-based decision support system for [health care policy decision making](/research) that concerns alternative treatment options.
ADDIS 2 has been under continuous development since 2014, and is largely feature complete, though we are always working to improve the platform and add features on request.

We believe that such an integrated system can improve the efficiency and transparency of systematic review and health care policy decision making by several orders of magnitude.
Efficiency can be improved by facilitating easier and more meaningful sharing of data and meta-data, while transparency will be enhanced by linking decisions to the underlying value judgments and clinical data.

Documentation
-------------

The [user manual for ADDIS](https://addis.drugis.org/manual.html) provides a detailed overview of the functionality in ADDIS, as well as  the statistical methods.

Our framework of thinking is captured by the following documents:

 - [ADDIS 2 requirements](/software/addis2/requirements)
 - [ADDIS 2 architecture](/software/addis2/architecture) (outdated)


Current status
--------------

As of October 2016, ADDIS 2 is mostly feature complete, and we are working on improving stability and usability. Funding from IMI GetReal terminates end of 2016, and we are exploring several options to continue the project.

The current stable version of ADDIS 2 is available at [addis.drugis.org](https://addis.drugis.org).

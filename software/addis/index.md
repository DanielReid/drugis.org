Aggregate Data Drug Information System (ADDIS) is an evidence-based decision support system for [health care policy decision making](/research) that concerns alternative treatment options.
ADDIS has been under continuous development since 2014, and is largely feature complete, though we are always working to improve the platform and add features on request.

We believe that such an integrated system can improve the efficiency and transparency of systematic review and health care policy decision making by several orders of magnitude.
Efficiency can be improved by facilitating easier and more meaningful sharing of data and meta-data, while transparency will be enhanced by linking decisions to the underlying value judgments and clinical data.

Documentation
-------------

The [user manual for ADDIS](https://addis.drugis.org/manual.html) provides a detailed overview of the functionality in ADDIS, as well as  the statistical methods.

Our framework of thinking is captured by the following documents:

 - [ADDIS requirements](/software/addis/requirements)


Current status
--------------

As of March 2016, ADDIS is feature complete, and most work is directed at serving clients' and users requests. The project is funded by IMI GetReal Initiative.

The current stable version of ADDIS is available at [addis.drugis.org](https://addis.drugis.org).

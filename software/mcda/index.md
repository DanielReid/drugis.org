title: MCDA web interface
---

<img src="/images/software/mcda/mcda.png" class="screen-shot right">

Our multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) web interface is a user interface for preference elicitation in MCDA models.
The backend uses our [R packages](/software/r-packages/) to perform the computations.

The MCDA web interface was initially funded by TI Pharma project Escher and integrated in ADDIS 2 with funding from IMI GetReal.
Further development and the creation of training materials is supported by IMI PROTECT.

Current status
--------------

At the time of writing, the MCDA tool is relatively mature, but lacks solid documentation.
Visit [mcda.drugis.org](https://mcda.drugis.org/) to give it a try.
You can log in using your Google account.

Source code
-----------

The source code for the MCDA web interface is available on GitHub, on [our organization page](https://github.com/drugis/). In addition, source code for the R packages is available from [Gert van Valkenhoef](https://github.com/gertvv/).

title: MCDA web interface
---

<img src="/images/software/mcda/mcda.png" class="screen-shot right">

Our multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) web interface lets the user enter or upload effects data, state their preferences about the relative importance of the different effects, and see the consequences of their preferences in both deterministic and stochastic benefit-risk analyses.
The backend uses our [R packages](/software/r-packages/) to perform the computations.

The MCDA web interface was initially funded by TI Pharma project Escher and integrated in [ADDIS](/software/addis) with funding from IMI GetReal.
Further development and the creation of training materials was supported by IMI PROTECT.
Current development is funded by the IMI GetReal Initiative.

Current status
--------------

At the time of writing, the MCDA tool is mature. A closed-source version implementing business-focused features such as user access management is under active development. Please [contact us](/contact) for more details on pricing and availability.

Visit [mcda.drugis.org](https://mcda.drugis.org/) to give it a try.

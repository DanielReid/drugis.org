We are proud to announce the seventh preview version of our web-based redevelopment of ADDIS, ADDIS 2 release 7.
This release had several themes.
First, we performed user testing for both [GeMTC-web](https://gemtc.drugis.org) and [Trialverse](https://trialverse.org).
Second, we expanded the network meta-analysis functionality of ADDIS, which is also available as a separate web-application at [GeMTC-web](https://gemtc.drugis.org).
Third, we expanded the study management functionality of [Trialverse](https://trialverse.org) with search and copying.
Fourth, we addressed the most common concerns of our test users.

Release 7 contains the following new features:

  - GeMTC:
      - Inline help for all terminology, along with a brief user's manual.
      - Allow model run length extension.
      - Allow specification of heterogeneity prior.
      - An overview screen for nodesplitting analysis of inconsistency.
      - Several improvements to the user interface based on user feedback.
  - Trialverse:
      - Study search.
      - Allow copying of others' studies to own datasets.

The functionality developed in release 7 is showcased in these videos:

The focus of the next release will be divided between three subjects:

  - Further improvements to the evidence synthesis functionality, including the addition of network meta-regression models.
  - Improving the integration between the ADDIS and Trialverse components.
  - Further user testing of the evidence synthesis functionality.

We are pleased to announce a new release for ADDIS 2 and our GeMTC web tool. This is not a major-version release, but does include a significant amount of bugfixes and stability improvements.

We are also happy to welcome Kārlis Zālīte to our [team](/about/team). He will be helping us with development as well as the process of making our project financially self-sustaining.

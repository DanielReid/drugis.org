We are proud to announce the eighth preview version of our web-based redevelopment of ADDIS, ADDIS 2 release 8.
This release had several themes.
First, we have merged our dataset management component (Trialverse) into [ADDIS](https://addis.drugis.org), with the aim of improving the efficiency and ease of data management and analysis.
Second, we added several analysis features to ADDIS and the standalone [GeMTC-web](https://gemtc.drugis.org) component, namely  meta-regression functionality and the ability to downweight observational data.
Third, we added the ability to perform benefit-risk analyses based on network meta-analyses to ADDIS.

Release 8 contains the following new features:

  - ADDIS:
      - Integrate Trialverse data management into main system.
      - Allow meta-regression analyses
      - Allow downweighting of studies by covariate (for example observational studies)
      - Allow Meta-benefit-risk analyses

The functionality developed in release 7 is showcased in these videos:

  - [Meta-regression](https://vimeo.com/groups/drugis/videos/160089655)
  - [Downweighting evidence](https://vimeo.com/groups/drugis/videos/160089644)
  - [Meta-benefit-risk analysis](https://vimeo.com/groups/drugis/videos/160089634)

The focus of the next release will be divided between three subjects:

  - Improvement in definition of concepts such as interventions, e.g. restriction interventions by dosage, or non-drug interventions
  - Facilitating study importing from clinical trials.gov, mostly focused on repairing incorrectly entered studies
  - Automatic report generation based on ADDIS projects.

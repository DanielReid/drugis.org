We are proud to announce the eighth preview version of our web-based redevelopment of ADDIS, [ADDIS 2](https://addis.drugis.org) release 8.  This release contains the following new features:

  - Integrate data management (formerly "trialverse") into the main ADDIS system ([demo video](https://vimeo.com/groups/drugis/videos/160089612))
  - Network meta-regression analyses ([demo video](https://vimeo.com/groups/drugis/videos/160089655))
  - Downweighting of studies, e.g. non-randomized studies ([demo video](https://vimeo.com/groups/drugis/videos/160089644))
  - Benefit-risk analyses based on meta-analyses ([demo video](https://vimeo.com/groups/drugis/videos/160089634))

The focus of the next release will be divided between three subjects:

  - Definition of concepts such as interventions, e.g. dosage restrictions and combination treatments
  - Importing studies from ClinicalTrials.gov
  - Automatic report generation based on ADDIS projects

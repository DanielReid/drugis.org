We are proud to announce the second preview version of our web-based redevelopment of ADDIS, ADDIS 2 release 2.
Although this is a very early preview, and still far from perfect, we invite everyone to give it a try at [addis.drugis.org](https://addis.drugis.org).
This release introduces basic network meta-analysis, using a random effects consistency model.
Unfortunately models for the assessment of heterogeneity and inconsistency are not yet available.
The functionality developed in both release 1 and release 2 is showcased in [this video](https://vimeo.com/100488949).

The next release will focus on providing more insight into the data that is available in each data set by letting you browse studies and critique their design.
We also plan to make improvements to the benefit-risk analysis module and improve the usability of ADDIS 2 in general.

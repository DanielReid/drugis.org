We are proud to announce the release of a new version of our web-based Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) tool.
The majority of this release was devoted to polishing the user interface, and introducing a new way of eliciting Partial Value Functions.
We invite everyone to try it out at [mcda.drugis.org](https://mcda.drugis.org/).

The release contains the following features and bug fixes:

 - Remove the MacBeth Partial Value Function elicitation, in favor of a method based on bisection
 - Add clear warnings when information will be destroyed
 - Add a legend to the heat maps
 - Report units of measurement more consistently, and display unbounded intervals correctly
 - Add [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com/) support (profile pictures)
 - Considerably improve client-side performance

Thanks to JoÃ«l Kuiper and Douwe Postmus for their work on this release, and the IMI PROTECT project for their support.

We are proud to announce the sixth preview version of our web-based redevelopment of ADDIS, ADDIS 2 release 6.
The majority of this release was devoted to expanding the network meta-analysis functionality of ADDIS.
We have also made this functionality available as a separate web-application at [gemtc.drugis.org](https://gemtc.drugis.org).
Release 6 contains the following new features:

  - Support 3 types of meta-analysis (network, pairwise, node-splitting).
  - Allow setting of model parameters (fixed effect vs. random effects, likelihood/link function, run-length parameters).
  - More model results (convergence diagnostics, relative effects plots for network meta-analyses, study effect forest plot for pairwise meta-analyses).

The functionality developed in release 6 is showcased in [this video](https://vimeo.com/groups/drugis/videos/136919976).

The focus of the next release will be divided between three subjects:

  - Expanding Trialverse with features to include others' extractions, and laying groundwork for automating tasks.
  - Further expanding the NMA functionality, allowing inter-model comparisons, the specification of prior distributions, and the exporting of figures and data so they can be used in reports.
  - User testing to improve the usability and stability of the platform.

We are proud to announce version 0.8 of our R package for network meta-analysis, [GeMTC](/software/r-packages/gemtc).

This new version adds support for network meta-regression models and models where some evidence (e.g. observation data) is down-weighted. See [GeMTC on CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gemtc/) for more information.

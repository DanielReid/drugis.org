We are proud to announce the third preview version of our web-based redevelopment of ADDIS, ADDIS 2 release 3.
Although this is a very early preview, and still far from perfect, we invite everyone to give it a try at [addis.drugis.org](https://addis.drugis.org).
Release 3 offers the following new features:

 - Viewing dataset and study details
 - An updated and much improved MCDA user interface
 - Lots of small updates to improve usability and transparency

The functionality developed in release 3 is showcased in [this video](https://vimeo.com/groups/drugis/videos/109911061).
The next release will focus on data entry and data management.

The improved MCDA user interface has also been propagated to our MCDA web application on [mcda.drugis.org](https://mcda.drugis.org).

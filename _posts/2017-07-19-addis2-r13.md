We are proud to announce ADDIS 2 release 13. This release contains the following new features and improvements:

 - We have removed the distinction between single-study-based benefit-risk analyses and network-based ones. Benefit-risk analyses can now combine data from single studies and network models on a per-outcome basis.
 - We've added the ability to manually enter effects data to the [stand-alone MCDA component](https://mcda.drugis.org)
 - We've made some changes to the structure of MCDA analyess, separating the problem definition and preference elicitation steps.
 - We've added harmonisation of quantities/units to study entry and intervention definition, as well as a tool to repair older definitions.
- We've drastically improved performance in many cases, especially the study data and history part.
- Many bugfixes as usual.

To see the new features in action, watch the [release video](https://vimeo.com/groups/drugis/videos/226316961).

Our coming release will be at the end of september. We expect to complete our rework of the MCDA component, focusing on aspects like entry of confidence-estimate based data, and interactive sensitivity analysis in the results screen.

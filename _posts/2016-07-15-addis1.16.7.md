Today we announce a new version of [ADDIS 1](/software/addis1/), [ADDIS 1.16.7](/software/addis1/addis1.16). ADDIS 1 is our old desktop application, and is no longer being actively developed.

This release adds the ability to export datasets to ADDIS 2. An API key is needed to do this, contact us ([info@drugis.org](mailto:info@drugis.org)) to obtain one for your account; make sure the e-mail address you contact us from matches the e-mail address of the Google account you use to log in to ADDIS.

Most importantly, 2014 saw the start of development on ADDIS 2.
We delivered three releases focussed on proving the feasibility of our architecture and reducing technological risk.
At the same time we delivered features that set up the conceptual framework of ADDIS 2 and enable focussed discussions with potential users.
We are now making progress on the data entry and data management component, for which we had to answer a number of difficult open questions regarding our data model and the version management of data sets.
We also set up a software sub-team within work package 4 of IMI GetReal, which will help us prioritize features and gather feedback from project partners.

We also had Bob Goeree complete his Industrial Engineering and Management internship and MSc project with us.
Bob worked on a prototype of a cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) component for ADDIS 2, an early demo of which is available on [cea.drugis.org](https://cea.drugis.org/).
His MSc thesis extended that work to establish how network meta-analysis should inform such analyses.
His thesis and internship report can be found on the [publications page](/research/publications/).

Gert van Valkenhoef spent October-December at the [Center for Evidence-Based Medicine](http://www.cebm.brown.edu/) at [Brown University](http://brown.edu/).
During this time, he worked with them on importing projects from their [Systematic Review Data Repository](http://srdr.ahrq.gov/) into ADDIS 2.
He also gave a number of talks, most notably at the Brown Biostatistics group and at ClinicalTrials.gov.
Slides of these talks are available on the [publications page](/research/publications/).

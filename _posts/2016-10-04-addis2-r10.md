 - Data entry: improved user interface, improved performance, and deleting studies.
 - Users can now access ADDIS without logging in.
 - Complete user manual for ADDIS (except benefit-risk analysis).
 - Significant improvements to performance of analysis result screens and significantly lowered bandwidth usage.

In the next release we will continue to focus on stability and usability, to deliver the best possible end product for the GetReal project.

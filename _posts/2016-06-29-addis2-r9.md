We are proud to announce the ninth preview version of our web-based redevelopment of ADDIS, [ADDIS 2](https://addis.drugis.org) release 9.  This release contains the following new features:

  - Definition of complex interventions ([demo video](https://vimeo.com/groups/drugis/videos/172721931))
  - Allow import of studies directly from clinicaltrials.gov ([demo video](https://vimeo.com/groups/drugis/videos/172721932))
  - Report view of project, and allow editing of mistakes with titles ([demo video](https://vimeo.com/groups/drugis/videos/172721930))

The focus of the next release will be divided between three subjects:

  - Sensitivity analysis
  - Assessing bias
  - Direct comparisons between models

We also plan to address several usability and stability issues.
